# Sudoku
Terminal sudoku with solver ai 
### How to run?
Run the main.exe or compile it yourself

### TODO
- save progress in file
- create opening grid from file (opening saved game)
- proper game over and testing
- create proper main menu with game modes like new game, saved games, quick match, timemode, no hints, no ai, open grid and fixed grid(cant change the starting numbers, colored green etc)
- make better tutorial
- Remove unncessary code and use structures for readability 

## Note: Only tested on windows, probably wont work on other devices due to hardcoded inputs for keys
